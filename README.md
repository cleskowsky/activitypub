My [forever project](https://ferd.ca/a-bridge-over-a-river-never-crossed.html). :)

I help keep medium-sized websites up, secure, and fast. Lately this has been less dev work, and more on the production ops side. I'd like to be able to work on a small-ish piece of software where I can play with some of the techstack we use at work, as well as try out different ways of monitoring, and debugging running code in production. All these things are highly relevant to what I do in a day!

This will eventually be a much-smaller-than-mastodon program that can participate in the fediverse.
